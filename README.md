# gostack12-desafio-conceitos-node
Challenge developed during the Rocketseat's gostack12 bootcamp to build an api using typescript and service/repository pattern. 

In this application we have HTTP routes that make possible the manipulation of 'Transactions' and balance, like a bank account.

The main goals are:
- API REST
- TypeScript in node.js
- Patterns like Repository and Service
